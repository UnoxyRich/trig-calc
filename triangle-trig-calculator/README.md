# Triangle Trig Calculator

## Overview
The Triangle Trig Calculator is a web application that allows users to input the lengths of the sides of a triangle and calculates the corresponding angles and visual representation of the triangle. It adheres to the triangle inequality theorem and provides immediate feedback on the validity of the triangle based on the input values.

## Features
- Input fields for the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
- Real-time calculation of angles based on the input sides.
- Visual representation of the triangle with labeled angles.
- Error handling for invalid triangle inputs.
